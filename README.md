## ðŸ’¾ MazaoCredit Data Repository

The **MazaoCredit Data Repository** is an integrated, multi-source data system designed to power the platform's AI-driven financial resilience and market matching features, specifically focusing on the underserved smallholder farmer community in Kenya. It centralizes and organizes the diverse datasets required for advanced credit scoring, parametric insurance, and sustainability tracking, ensuring the data is fair, transparent, and scalable for real-world agri-finance systems.

### **Core Data Categories & Sources**

The repository is built to ingest and correlate five primary categories of data:

| Data Category | Primary Data Points | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational/Platform Data** | Farmer Listings, Quantity, Location, Buyer-Farmer Matches, Direct Communication Logs, Trust & Reputation Ratings. | MazaoCredit's Multi-Channel Platform (Web App, USSD/SMS, Hotline). |
| **Financial/Transaction Data** | M-Pesa History, Transaction History on the platform, Sales Performance, Loan Inquiry Logs, Repayment Outcomes (Simulated/Real). | Integrated M-Pesa API, Microfinance Navigator module. |
| **Environmental/Risk Data** | Historical Rainfall, Soil Health Indicators, Real-time Weather Alerts, Satellite Data on Farm Size and Crop Yields, Imminent Pest Risks (e.g., armyworm). | External Weather/Satellite Data APIs, Climate Monitoring Services. |
| **Social Collateral Data** | Guaranter Network (4 Vouchers), Referral Links, Network Building Points/Scores. | Social Collateral module on the MazaoCredit platform. |
| **Sustainability/Input Data** | Farmer-listed inputs (Fertilizer, Transport, Energy Use), Calculated "Carbon Score" (Kg, CO2e per 100Kg of produce). | Carbon Footprint Tracking module (via Claude.ai layer and SMS/USSD input). |

### **Key Repository Functions & Alignment**

* **AI-Powered Credit Scoring:** Serves as the single source of truth for the **Financial Readiness Score**. It combines transactional, environmental, and social collateral data to move beyond traditional credit models and assess smallholder farmers' creditworthiness fairly and accurately.
* **Risk & Simulation Engine:** Stores and provides both historical and real-time environmental data to enable dynamic risk updates, what-if testing (e.g., simulating droughts), and the logic for the Parametric Crop Insurance module.
* **Fairness & Bias Mitigation:** The repository architecture supports continuous fairness checks and inclusion-focused modeling. It ensures data across critical attributes like gender, region, and farm size is available and analyzed to avoid bias in lending decisions.
* **Data Governance & Open-Source Focus:** It is designed for **reproducible and scalable pipelines**, aligning with the hackathon's emphasis on ethical AI and the Data Governance in Africa initiative.

### **Expected Deliverables from the Repository**

The repository is the foundation for the core deliverables required by the Jury:

* **Trained Model / Notebook:** Provides the cleaned, processed, and synthetic datasets necessary to reproduce the ML pipeline.
* **Loan Simulation Logic:** Supplies the structured data outputs and risk parameters required to link model predictions to lending decisions.
